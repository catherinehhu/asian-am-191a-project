# ASIAN AM 191A Project — Oil Drilling in Inglewood

We used free hosting on GitHub Pages and built this site using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and Leaflet.JS for mapping. Our data is stored and accessed through a Google Sheets file. 

In order for the project that we build to be more accessible and easily maintained (or applied to other community engagement work), we've set up the form and site in a way that can automatically populate the map with new responses, host the site on a free service, and will keep the code public on GitHub so people can help help maintain it and other organizations/individuals can use it as the basis for other sites they’d like to create. 

Moreover, to protect the individuals who share their stories with us, we do not record any personally identifiable information such as phone number, email, or address. To aid in our mapping process, we only ask for zip code, which is general enough to provide respondents with anonymity when filling out our survey.
