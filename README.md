# ASIAN AM 191A Project â€” Group 4 

## What social problem is being addressed?
While Los Angeles recently voted to stop adding new oil drilling sites within city limits, there are still thousands of active or inactive (but unsealed) sites that pose health and environmental risks to the people who live near them. 
## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
We hope our project will help empower people who are affected by oil drilling in Los Angeles, as well as provide accessible information for individuals and community organizations. 
## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
- In order to make a robust mapping tool that might be useful beyond the course of this class, we hope to keep our site up and automate the updating of people's stories (perhaps using the Google Sheets/Airtable API), but this would require more exploration. 
- Since we are hoping to link stories to locations, this raises several questions: how accurately do we map a story to a certain address? Should we keep everyone anonymous? What if people want to publicize their own stories? How do we best protect these people? 
- Moreover, while we want to collect insight from community members, we are aware of our presence as outsiders to these communities and do not want to be extractive of the individuals who take the time to share their stories with us. We also plan to contact coalitions like Stand Together Against Neighborhood Drilling (STAND-L.A.) to see if there is a way to reach more people through community organizations. 
- Technical problems we may run into would be conducting outreach and having people submit their responses. 
- Another slight technical issue would be the questions and how we decide to frame them. What do these questions necessarily reveal about the issue?
