# ASIAN AM 191A Project — Oil Drilling in Inglewood

This project’s primary objectives are to help raise awareness among those living near the Inglewood Oil Field about the health effects and prevalence of oil drilling, as well as to empower residents to share their stories, find support in their community, and advocate for the safe and effective closure of oil wells. Beyond impacting individuals, this site is intended to be utilized as a tool by community organizations such as STAND LA to more effectively facilitate change in their fight to end neighborhood oil drilling with the power of community-sourced data.

We used free hosting on GitHub Pages and built this site using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and Leaflet.JS for mapping. Our data is stored and accessed through a Google Sheets file. Moreover, to protect the individuals who share their stories with us, we do not record any personally identifiable information such as phone number, email, or address. To aid in our mapping process, we only ask for zip code, which is general enough to provide respondents with anonymity when filling out our survey. 

In order for the project that we build to be more accessible and easily maintained (or applied to other community engagement work), we've set up the form and site in a way that can automatically populate the map with new responses, host the site on a free service, and will keep the code public on GitHub so people can help help maintain it and other organizations/individuals can use it as the basis for other sites they’d like to create.
