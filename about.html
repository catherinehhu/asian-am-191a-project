                <h4> Why neighborhood oil drilling?</h4>
                <p> Thousands of oil drilling sites are concentrated in Los Angeles, 
                  which houses the largest urban oil field in the United States (Assessing the Health and Community Impacts 
                  of Oil Drilling Near Homes in South Los Angeles). These oil drills are often located near low-income neighborhoods 
                  where primarily people of color reside. For example, according to an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-oil-well-drilling-idle-cleanup/map/">LA Times map of oil drilling sites</a> in Los Angeles, Ladera 
                  Heights is one such highly impacted neighborhood where 68.97% of its residents are Black or African 
                  American (Ladera Heights, California Population 2023). Both active and inactive oil wells, especially when unsealed, 
                  have well-documented negative impacts on people's health. These impacts often include headaches, asthma, nosebleeds, 
                  and an increased risk of cancer among affected residents. 
                </p>
                <h4> About our survey and map</h4>
                <p> Our project aims to serve as a platform for individuals residing near the Inglewood oil drill to share their health 
                    experiences and stories. By doing so, we aspire to empower communities, fostering unity in the face of this environmental injustice.
                   We seek to accompolish this through a publicily available survey available in English and Spanish. After taking the survey, 
                   the responses will be shared publicly so the community can interact and learn from people in their community.
                   <a href="survey.html"><b>Take the survey</b></a> to share your story with your community. 
                </p>
