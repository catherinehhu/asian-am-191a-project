            <h2> Health Effects of Oil Drilling in Los Angeles </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="main"> 
              
                <h3> About the Project</h3>
                <p> Thousands of oil drilling sites are concentrated in Los Angeles, 
                  which houses the largest urban oil field in the United States (Assessing the Health and Community Impacts 
                  of Oil Drilling Near Homes in South Los Angeles). These oil drills are often located near low-income neighborhoods 
                  where primarily people of color reside; according to an LA Times map of oil drilling sites in Los Angeles, Ladera 
                  Heights near Culver City is one such highly impacted neighborhood, and 68.97% of its residents are Black or African 
                  American (Ladera Heights, California Population 2023). Oil wells – both active and inactive, though unsealed – have 
                  well-documented negative impacts upon people’s health, leading to headaches, asthma, nosebleeds, and cancer in affected residents. 
                </p>
                <p> Our project hopes to act as a platform for people living near neighborhood oil drills to share their health experiences and stories,
                   which may hopefully act as a source of empowerment for communities to stand together against this environmental injustice. 
                   Through our map, we seek to provide accessible information for community members around the Inglewood Oil Field about the health effects 
                   (and the prevalence of these health effects) due to living near urban oil wells. Take the survey to share your story and inform your community. 
                </p>
